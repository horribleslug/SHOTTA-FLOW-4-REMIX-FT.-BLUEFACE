The year is 2045. Good hip-hop is dead, wiped off the face of the earth and turned into endless monotony by the four horsemen of boring bars: Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, Jay Z and Drake. But from the depths of despair arise NLE Choppa, Blueface, Lil Xan, and 6ix9ine, aided by the spirits of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, who have put their past beef behind them to unite and save music forever. They shall come together to create the single most monumental release music has ever seen: Shotta Flow 4 (ft. Blueface) [Remix]
